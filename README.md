## Project Description

In this project we have analyzed gene expression of a metastatic breast cancer treatment that combines pembrolizumab (anti-PD1 antibody), exemestane (nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor), and leuprolide (gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist). We discovered deferentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pre and post treatment patients to elicit gene level treatment efficacy. We further explored gene expression levels of 4 different gene classes: Endogenous, Household, Positive, Negative. As well as looking into how the DEGs are spread between the classes.

We have adhered to using tidyverse functions when applicable and have followed the KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple) coding philosophy.
